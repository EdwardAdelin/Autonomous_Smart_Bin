# Autonomous_Smart_Bin
A smart bin system made for people who need to monitorise the bin status at any time. Suitable for smart houses, HOA or even  businesses.

# Instructions
1. Flash the code on you PICO W micro-controller.
2. Build your smart bin following the diagram.
3. Ensure WI-FI connection ( write updated network name and password in micropython code )
4. Use Thony IDE ( or any other IDE ) to run the code on PICO W.
5. By accessing PICO W server you can control the bin. The server IP is given by the software, after you run it in Thony. For other IDEs is similar, you just need to make PICO visible by VS Code or other IDE, by using some special extensions (maybe in the future PICO W will be supported in standard by many more IDEs)
